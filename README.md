# About This Repository

This repository consists of SQL class exercises completed during a 1-month SQL class conducted by Pacmann. All exercises utilize a single database named "3_odds." Below is a breakdown of each exercise:

### 3rd Meeting - Basic Queries Exercises

In this exercise, I answered the following questions and performed the following tasks:

1. Show product information for products whose product line is neither "Motorcycle" nor "Planes."
2. Display distinct values from the product_line column in the products table.
3. Calculate projected total sales for each product if all stock is sold out, and the selling price is 10% greater than the MSRP.
4. Show product data whose name contains the words "ship" or "motto."
5. Display the three cheapest products (by MSRP) from the product lines "classic cars" and "vintage."
6. Identify 10 products that will generate the most profit for the company if the selling price follows the vendor's recommendation (profit = revenue - selling price of the product).

### 4th Meeting - Aggregation Exercises

In this exercise, I answered the following questions and performed the following tasks:

1. Present information about the total, average, and maximum credit limit from the customer table.
2. Identify cities with customers having zero credit limits and determine the number of customers in each city.
3. Count the number of customers with a credit limit above the average.
4. Provide information about the date when each customer made their first payment.
5. List three customers who have made the most transactions.
6. Calculate the average credit limit of customers from cities in Germany and France.
7. Present information on the top three countries with the highest percentage of customers.

### 5th Meeting - Join Exercises

In this exercise, I answered the following questions and performed the following tasks:

1. Display product information that has been ordered.
2. Identify products that are still in the processing stage and calculate the potential revenue generated by these products.
3. Present data regarding the remaining stock of products that have been ordered and the percentage of product sold compared to the total stock (assuming total stock = quantityOrdered + quantityStock).
4. Identify products selling for 20 percent below the vendor's recommended price.
5. Provide information about customers who have placed orders, along with the names and quantities of products ordered.

### 6th Meeting - Subquery Exercises

In this exercise, I answered the following questions and performed the following tasks:

1. Create a query to display the highest payment amount.
2. Write a query to display all customers whose payments exceed the average payment of all payments.
3. Create a query to display all customers who have made payments and are from California ('CA').
4. Present customer data for those who have not made any payments.
5. Create a query to display employees who work in America.
6. Determine the day on which most payment processes take place among all payment data.
7. Utilize CTE to create a query displaying data on the top 5 employees who generated the most sales in 2003 (assuming the order status is 'shipped').

### 7th Meeting - Functions and Procedures Exercises

In this exercise, I answered the following questions and performed the following tasks:

1. Created a function to determine the amount of bonus each sales representative gets based on sales performance.
   - Sales > 400,000: Bonus of 15,000
   - Sales between 200,001 and 400,000: Bonus of 10,000
   - Sales between 100,000 and 200,000: Bonus of 5,000
   - Sales less than 100,000: No bonus (0).
2. Created a query to categorize customers based on the number of orders made, including categories such as "one-time customer," "repeated customer," "frequent customer," and "loyal customer."
3. Developed a procedure to provide information on the 10 best-selling items in 2004.
4. Created a query to count the number of orders that were sent (status = 'Shipped') and orders that were canceled (status = 'Cancelled').
